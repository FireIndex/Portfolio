        <h2>What Were the Objectives of the Project?</h2>
        <p>
          The journey of creating Writer began with a simple idea: to develop a
          tool that would help users manage their <strong>notes</strong> and
          <strong>collaborate</strong> with others more effectively.
          <em></em>
        </p>

        <p>
          The project UI for Writer is inspired by the UI of

          on GitHub. While I drew inspiration from this UI design, I made
          several modifications and added numerous functionalities using
          React.js to tailor it to the specific needs of Writer.
          <strong>The backend, however, is entirely my own creation,</strong>
          developed to ensure robust performance and seamless integration with
          the enhanced frontend.<br />
